# Date_and_Time_Handling_in_Pandas
-- This repository is dedicated to demonstrating effective ways of handling and analyzing date and time data using Pandas in Python.

# Features
- Date and Time Representation: Understanding different date and time representations in Pandas, including timestamps, periods, and timedeltas.

- Date and Time Operations: Comprehensive examples of performing operations like date arithmetic, time zone conversions, and date comparisons.

- Data Analysis with Dates and Times: Techniques for analyzing time series data, including resampling, shifting, and rolling calculations.

# Importing the Required Libraries
- import pandas as pd
# Handling Date and Time Data
# Load data into a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03'], 'value': [10, 20, 15]})

# Convert 'date' column to datetime
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

# Perform various operations on the datetime column
df['year'] = df['date'].dt.year
df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month
